# EXEC.bin
This is the actual File loader and will load *.hh3 files until I decide to add to the acceptable files (Might add *.game or *.mdos or *.bin)
The Version of Casio's official updater That is currently supported is v2.02.7002.1000, that is used, so all functions are still available (might get rid of Program app and add Python)
